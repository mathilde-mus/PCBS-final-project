#Programming an experiment on bin colour detection:

##MOTIVATION OF THE PROJECT:
My goal is to show that subjects better detect red trash bags than grey ones in pictures taken in the streets of Paris, in order to change the mind of the Mairie de Paris regarding the colour choice of trash bags. I am doing an internship with a PhD student who works on this theme. However, she has programmed her experiment on Qualtrics to be exportable to UK participants. My goal is to program it using Python and especially the expyriment module.

##DESCRIPTION AND GOAL OF THE TASK:
Participants have to decide if they saw or not a bin in a flashed picture (750ms). Pictures are randomized so that there are pictures with red bins, grey bins and no bins in each block. I am then comparing the hit rates and false alarm rates of pictures with red bins and of those with grey bins. I calculate a d' (see Signal Detection Theory) and I wish to obtain that d'(red) > d'(grey) thus proving that subjects more correctly detect red bins than grey bins.
